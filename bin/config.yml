#How to assign tags to groups - should be in the form "group,colour" (no space)
#Groups must be exactly as in permissions.yml, case insensitive. Will appear ingame as written here
#Colours should be as seen in game (d represents pink etc.)
#All groups not assigned colours will be given the prefix "&8Cat", to avoid needing too many
#Use "s" to get SeniorAdmin premade tag, "u" for UltimateKat, "w" for Owner
#Leave blank to disable nameplate changing
#Tags will be assigned with a priority based on position - player with KoolKat and Mod will be tagged as mod
